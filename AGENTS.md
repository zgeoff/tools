# Agent Guidelines

## Operations

- Perform all work on a branch in a git worktree under `.worktrees/` (e.g.
  `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>`) — never commit directly on `main`.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- When the work is ready, open a PR against `main` using the PR template
  (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
- PR descriptions are condensed by default: lead paragraph ≤2 sentences, one-line bullets, ≤150
  words. Write the short version first — do not draft long and trim.
- After pushing, link the opened PR's URL in your response so it's one click away.

## Type checking

Type errors are checked by two engines on purpose: `lint:type-aware` includes tsgolint's
experimental `--type-check` (fast, run it locally), while `typecheck` runs real `tsc` per package
(ground truth). CI runs both until tsgolint earns trust; if they ever disagree, believe `tsc`.

## Code style

- One primary export per file, and the file name kebab-cases that export (`with-jest-context.ts`
  exports `withJestContext`). Exceptions: `index.ts` entrypoints, `types.ts` for a package's shared
  types, and side-effect-only modules, which are named for what they do (`augment-bun-test.ts`).
- Function names start with a verb from the closed list below (see "Function naming") — the prefix
  declares the function's contract.
- Acronyms stay uppercase in identifiers (`runCLI`, `parseCLIArgs`, `ASTNode`, `pkgURL`,
  `isPackageJSON`) — except when one starts a camelCase name, where it lowercases whole (`cliPath`,
  `astNode`). File names are unaffected: kebab-case lowercases everything (`parse-cli-args.ts`
  exports `parseCLIArgs`).
- Module order: imports, then the primary export, then private helpers in composition order
  (depth-first). Don't lead with helpers. Non-function supporting declarations (consts, interfaces,
  type aliases) sit directly above the first declaration that uses them — never below their last
  use, and never leading the file (types for the primary export's signature are the one exception:
  they may sit just above it).
- Comments that document a declaration (function, class, interface, member, module-scope const) are
  JSDoc blocks (`/** … */`) so editors surface them on hover; `//` is for statement-level commentary
  inside bodies. Attach the block to the declaration it describes — a doc above the wrong `const`
  binds to that const.
- Comments describe the code as it is. Never reference its history ("the old implementation",
  "previously", "now uses") or the change that produced it — that context lives in commit messages
  and goes stale the moment it merges.
- Comments don't name other declarations — renames silently strand the reference. State the role or
  contract instead: "callers must pass edits sorted last-to-first", not "(buildEditsFromAST's
  contract)". A declaration's own parameters and signature types are fine to name in its doc.

### Function naming

The verb list is closed: pick from it, or extend this file in the same PR that introduces the new
verb. The prefix is a contract — a reader should know the function's shape without opening it.

**Predicates** — return boolean, no side effects:

| Prefix   | Contract                | Example          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | type or state test      | `isVarDecl`      |
| `has`    | containment, possession | `hasBlankLine`   |
| `can`    | capability              | `canResize`      |
| `should` | policy decision         | `shouldSkipFile` |
| `needs`  | requirement             | `needsBlankLine` |

**Pure producers** — result comes from arguments alone, no side effects:

| Prefix                        | Contract                                                                  | Example             |

| `find`                        | search that can miss — null/undefined on miss                             | `findPrevious`      |
| `get`                         | cheap access that cannot miss (throwing on a broken invariant is fine)    | `getNodeEnd`        |
| `collect`                     | gather from a traversal or scan                                           | `collectChildNodes` |

| `merge`                       | parts → one value                                                         | `mergeWindows`      |

| `format`                      | value → human-readable string                                             | `formatRange`       |
| `render`                      | structure → output text or markup                                         | `renderHunk`        |
| `normalize`                   | variant forms → the canonical form                                        | `normalizePath`     |
| `resolve`                     | follow indirection to a concrete value                                    | `resolveBinPath`    |
| `expand`                      | compact form → full form                                                  | `expandInputs`      |
| `to<Result>`                  | cheap representation change                                               | `toPosixPath`       |
| `transform`                   | a package's own source→source operation                                   | `transform`         |

**Effectful** — touches the world (filesystem, streams, processes, registries):

| Prefix     | Contract                                                                                                                                | Example           |

| `try<X>`   | X with failures captured as a value instead of a throw                                                                                  | `tryCheckFile`    |
| `register` | add to a registry the caller doesn't own                                                                                                | `registerMatcher` |
| `assert`   | throw when an invariant doesn't hold                                                                                                    | `assertSpan`      |
| `emit`     | dispatch an event or notification                                                                                                       | `emitProgress`    |
| `send`     | transmit a payload to a remote receiver (fire-and-forget or RPC — no resource semantics; REST mutations are `create`/`update`/`remove`) | `sendWebhook`     |

**Wrappers and factories:**

| Prefix    | Contract                                  | Example           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `with<X>` | HOF that runs a callback inside a context | `withJestContext` |
| `make<X>` | factory whose result is itself a function | `makeExcluder`    |

**Framework conventions** — where the ecosystem's prefix is load-bearing, it wins:

| Prefix          | Contract                                                                                                                | Example          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `use<X>`        | React hook — the prefix drives rules-of-hooks linting; helpers inside a hook follow the normal taxonomy                 | `useDebounce`    |
| `on<Event>`     | event-callback prop or parameter                                                                                        | `onRowClick`     |
| `handle<Event>` | local implementation passed to an `on<Event>` prop — the idiomatic React pair; the `handle` ban applies everywhere else | `handleRowClick` |

**Banned** — each is a vaguer or synonymous form of a listed verb; use that one instead: `handle`
(except React's `handle<Event>`, above), `process`, `manage`, `do`, `perform` (say what it does),
`execute` (→ `run`), `compute` (→ `build`), `fetch` (→ `read`), `save`/`store` (→ `write`), `delete`
(→ `remove`), `search`/`lookup` (→ `find`/`get`).

Algorithm-native vocabulary (`walk`, `backtrack`, `slideDiagonal`) is allowed inside the module
implementing that algorithm — forcing list verbs onto textbook terms hides the algorithm.

## Testing

- Never use `describe` — write flat `test('it does a thing', …)` blocks.
- Tests declare their own data inline — no fixtures shared between tests, even if that means
  duplication.
- Reach for jest-extended matchers instead of hand-rolling assertions. Frequently useful:
  - arrays
    - `toIncludeAllMembers`
    - `toIncludeSameMembers`
    - `toPartiallyContain`
    - `toIncludeAllPartialMembers`
    - `toSatisfyAll`
  - objects
    - `toContainEntry`
    - `toContainEntries`
    - `toContainAllKeys`
    - `toBeFrozen`
  - strings
    - `toStartWith`
    - `toEndWith`
    - `toInclude`
    - `toEqualCaseInsensitive`
    - `toEqualIgnoringWhitespace`
  - values
    - `toBeNil`
    - `toBeOneOf`
    - `toSatisfy`
    - `toBeWithin`
    - `toBeEmpty`
  - dates
    - `toBeAfter`
    - `toBeBefore`
    - `toBeBetween`
    - `toBeValidDate`
  - mocks
    - `toHaveBeenCalledOnce`
    - `toHaveBeenCalledExactlyOnceWith`
    - `toHaveBeenCalledBefore`
    - `toHaveBeenCalledAfter`
  - errors/async
    - `toThrowWithMessage`
    - `toResolve` (returns a promise — always `await`)
    - `toReject` (returns a promise — always `await`)
- Matchers also work asymmetrically inside `toEqual`/`toMatchObject`
  (`status: expect.toBeOneOf([…])`).
- Known gaps: `expect.pass`/`expect.fail` are unimplemented upstream and excluded from our types.
  It's `toEqualCaseInsensitive` — not `…Insensitively` as some docs claim; unknown matcher names
  fail typecheck here (upstream's own types are looser and would let typos through).

## Dependencies

- Pin exact versions — no `^`/`~` ranges. Shared versions live in the root catalog; workspace
  packages reference them via `catalog:`. (`bun add` saves exact automatically via `exact = true` in
  bunfig.toml — the rule applies to hand-written edits.)
